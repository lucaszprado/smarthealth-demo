## Important notes regarding the building phase or implementation of this scope

**Plus button UX**
The UX interaction required by the mobile experience is already implemented in a JS controller called modal_backdrop_controller.js . We can generalize this controller to bring the interaction to this situation as well.

**Hotwire and JavaScript integration**
As described in the @system_patterns.md file, JavaScript must be implemented as much as possible using Hotwire and Stimulus. Vanilla JavaScript should be used only when Hotwire and Stimulus are not enough.
