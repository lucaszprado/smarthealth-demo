# Project Brief

## Problem
- Currently our application only digitize blood exams pdfs, build historical series of each biomarker and display the series on a chart.
- From a user perspective there's value about seeing measures from different exam PDFs in a single timeline. However since we have all the biomarkers measures with its respective measure date and range status in our database, we think we can deliver more:
    - Allow users to directly compare two biomarkers measures in our application instead of downloading the measure and comparing it into an excel file.

## Objective
This project aims to allow users to see two or more biomarkers on the same chart.

### Key Elements
1. Refactored Chart Controller to allow more than one biomarker series and functions to add and remove biomarker series.
2. Biomarker selector and input into Chart Controller
3. Time range selector and input into Chart Controller


### Out of scope and No-Gos
